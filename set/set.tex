This document is based upon Appendix~A of [1] and used by permission of Springer.

The presentation of mathematical logic in [1] is based upon an informal use of set theory whose definitions and theorems are summarized here. For an elementary, but detailed, development of set theory, see [3].

\section{Finite and infinite sets}

The concept of an \emph{element} is undefined, but informally the
concept is clear: an element is any identifiable object like a number,
color or node of a graph. Sets are built from elements.

\begin{definition}
A \emph{set}\index{Set} is composed of
\emph{elements}.\index{Set!element} $a\in S$ denotes
that $a$ is an element of set $S$ and $a\not\in S$ denotes that $a$ is \emph{not} an element of $S$. The set with no
elements is the \emph{empty set},\index{Set!empty} denoted
$\emptyset$. Capital letters like $S$, $T$ and $U$
are used for sets.
\end{definition}

There are two ways to define a set: (a) We can explicitly write the
elements comprising the set. If a set is large and if it is clearly
understood what its elements are, an ellipsis `$\ldots$' is used to
indicate the elements not explicitly listed. (b) A set may be defined by
\emph{set comprehension}, where the set is specified to be composed of
all elements that satisfy a condition. Elements of sets are written within braces $\{\;\}$.


\begin{example}\mbox{}
\begin{itemize}
\item The set of colors of a traffic light is $\{\textit{red}, \textit{yellow}, \textit{green}\}$.

\item The set of atomic elements is $\{\textit{hydrogen}, \textit{helium}, \textit{lithium}, \ldots\}$.

\item $\mathbb{Z}$, the set of
\emph{integers},\index{Integers} is $\{\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots\}$.

\item $\mathbb{N}$\index{Natural numbers}, the set of \emph{natural numbers}, is $\{0,1,2,\ldots\}$. $\mathbb{N}$ can also be defined by set comprehension: $\mathbb{N}=\{n\in \mathbb{Z} \mid n\geq 0\}$. Read this as ``$\mathbb{N}$ is the set of all integers such that $n$ is greater or equal to zero.''

\item $E$, the set of even natural numbers, is $\{n\in \mathbb{N} \mid n \bmod 2 = 0\}$.

\item $P$, the set of prime numbers, is:
\[
\{n\in \mathbb{N} \mid n\geq 2 \textrm{\ and\ } (n \bmod m = 0 \textrm{\ implies\ } (m=1 \mathrm{\ or\ } m=n))\}.
\]
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

There is no meaning to the order of the elements in a set or to
repetition of elements: $\{3,2,1,1,2,3\}=\{1,2,3\}=\{3,1,2\}$.
A set containing a single element (a \emph{singleton set})
and the element itself are not the same: $5\in \{5\}$.

\section{Subset}

\begin{definition}
Let $S$ and $T$ be sets. $S$ is a \emph{subset}\index{Set!subset} of
$T$, denoted $S\subseteq T$, iff every element of
$S$ is an element of $T$, that is, $x\in S$ implies $x \in T$. $S$ is a
\emph{proper subset}\index{Set!proper subset} of $T$, denoted $S\subset
T$, iff $S\subseteq T$ and $S\neq T$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
$\mathbb{N}\subset \mathbb{Z}\comma\; E \subset \mathbb{N}\comma\; \{\mathit{red},\mathit{green}\}\subset \{\mathit{red}, \mathit{yellow}, \mathit{green}\}\comma\; \{\mathit{red},\mathit{green}\}\subseteq \{\mathit{green}, \mathit{red}\}$.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem} $\emptyset \subseteq T$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We have to show that $x \in T$ holds for all $x\in \emptyset$. But there are no elements in $\emptyset$, so the statement is vacuously true.
\end{proof}

The relationships among sets can be shown graphically by the use
of \emph{Venn diagrams}.\index{Venn diagram} These are closed curves
drawn in the plane and labeled with the name of a set. A point is in the
set if it is within the interior of the curve. In the following diagram, $S$ is a subset of $T$ since every point within $S$ is also within $T$.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[thick,rounded corners] (0,0) node[xshift=3.1cm,yshift=2.7cm] {$T$}
  rectangle +(6,3);
\draw[thick,rounded corners] (1,.8) node[xshift=2cm,yshift=.8cm] {$S$}
  rectangle +(4,1.5);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{theorem}The subset property is transitive:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $S\subseteq T$ and $T\subseteq U$ then $S\subseteq U$.
\item If $S\subset T$ and $T\subseteq U$ then $S\subset U$.
\item If $S\subseteq T$ and $T\subset U$ then $S\subset U$.
\item If $S\subset T$ and $T\subset U$ then $S\subset U$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let us prove (2). By the assumption $S\subset T$: if $x\in S$ then $x\in T$. By the assumption $T\subseteq U$ if $x\in T$ then $x\in U$. Therefore, $S\subseteq U$. We have to show that $S\neq U$. By assumption, $S \subset T$ so $S\neq T$ and there is an element $x\in S$ and $x\not \in T$. Therefore, $x\not \in U$ so $S\neq U$.
\end{proof}

\section{Proving inclusion and equality of sets}

To prove $S\subseteq T$ choose an \emph{arbitrary} element $x\in S$
and show $x\in T$.

\begin{example}
Prove that every prime number greater than $2$ is odd. Formally:
\begin{eqnarray*}
S&=&\{n \in \mathbb{N} \mid n>2 \textrm{\ and \ } x\in P\}\\ 
T&=& \{n\in \mathbb{N} \mid n=2k+1 \textrm{\ for some \ } k\in \mathbb{N}\}\\
S&\stackrel{?}{\subseteq}& T\,.
\end{eqnarray*}
Let $n$ be an \emph{arbitrary} element of $S$. Suppose that $n\not\in T$. Then $n=2k$ for some $k\in \mathbb{N}$. If $k=0$ or $k=1$, $n=1$ or $n=2$, then $n\not>2$ and $n\not\in S$. Otherwise, $n>2$ has (at least) the factors $2,k$ that are different from $1$ and $n$, so $n\not \in S$. Since $n$ was an arbitrary element of $S$, $S\subseteq T$.
\end{example}

To prove that two sets are equal, use the following theorem whose proof is left to the reader:
\begin{theorem}\label{thm.setsequal}
\ind $S=T$ iff $S\subseteq T$ and $T\subseteq S$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
Prove that $E$, the set of even natural numbers, is equal to the set of natural numbers of the form $2k$ for $k\in\mathbb{N}$. Formally:
\begin{eqnarray*}
S&=&\{n\in \mathbb{N} \mid  n \bmod 2 = 0\}\\
T&=&\{n\in \mathbb{N} \mid \textrm{\ for some\ } k\in \mathbb{N}, n=2k\}\\
S&\stackrel{?}{=}&T\,.
\end{eqnarray*}

Let $m\in S$. Then $m\bmod 2 = 0$, which by definition means there is a $k\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $m=2k+0=2k$. Therefore, $m\in T$ and $S\subseteq T$. If $m\in T$, then there is a $k$ such that $m=2k=2k+0$ so $m\bmod 2=0$. Therefore, $T\subseteq S$. By the theorem $S=T$.
\end{example}

\section{Union, intersection and difference}


\begin{definition}\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $S\cup T=\{x\mid x\in S \textrm{\ or \ } x\in T\}$, the \emph{union}\index{Set!union} of
$S$ and $T$, is the set consisting of those elements which are elements
of \emph{either} $S$ \emph{or} $T$ or both.

\item $S\cap T\{x\mid x\in S \textrm{\ and \ } x\in T\}$, the \emph{intersection}\index{Set!intersection} of $S$ and $T$, is the set consisting of those elements which are elements of \emph{both} $S$ \emph{and} $T$. If $S\cap T=\emptyset$ then $S$ and $T$ are \emph{disjoint}.\index{Set!disjoint}

\item $S-T=\{x\mid x\in S \textrm{\ and \ } x\not\in T\}$, the \emph{difference}\index{Set!difference} of $S$ and $T$, is the set of elements of $S$ that are not elements of $T$.

\item Let $U$ be understood as a universal set; then $\overline{T}$, the
\emph{complement}\index{Set!complement} of $T$, is $U-T$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

The following Venn diagram illustrates these concepts.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.8]
\draw[thick,rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle +(6,3);
\draw[thick,rounded corners] (4,0) rectangle +(6,3);
\node at (.5,2.5) {$S$};
\node at (9.5,2.5) {$T$};
\node at (2,1.5) {$S-T$};
\node at (8,1.5) {$T-S$};
\node at (5,1.5) {$S\cap T$};
\draw[thick,<->] (0,3.5) -- node[fill=white] {$S\cup T$} (10,3.5);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\begin{example} Here are some examples of the operations on sets:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{lll}
\{\mathit{red}, \mathit{yellow}\} \cup \{\mathit{red}, \mathit{green}\} &=& \{\mathit{red}, \mathit{yellow}, \mathit{green}\}, \\
\{\mathit{red}, \mathit{yellow}\} \cap \{\mathit{red}, \mathit{green}\} &=& \{\mathit{red}\}, \\
\{\mathit{red}, \mathit{yellow}\} - \{\mathit{red}, \mathit{green}\} &=& \{\mathit{yellow}\}, \\
P \cap E &=& \{2\}.
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}\qed
\end{example}

The following theorem states some simple properties of the set
operators.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm.seteq}\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $T = (T-S) \cup (S\cap T)$.

\item If $S\subseteq T$ then:
$\;\;S \cap T = S\comma \;\; S \cup T = T\comma\;\; S - T = \emptyset$.

\item If $S$ and $T$ are disjoint then $S-T=S$.

\item $S \cup \emptyset = S\comma\;\; S \cap \emptyset = \emptyset\comma\;\;
S - \emptyset = S$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
\item See the Venn diagram above.

\item See the following Venn diagram.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{scope}
\clip (0,0) rectangle +(5,4);
\draw[very thick,rounded corners] (0,0) rectangle +(5,4);
\foreach \y in {.5,1,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5}
  \draw[very thin,white!50!black] (0,\y) -- (5,\y);
\end{scope}
\begin{scope}
\clip (1,1) rectangle +(3,2);
\draw[very thick,rounded corners] (1,1) rectangle +(3,2);
\foreach \x in {1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5}
  \draw[very thin,white!50!black] (\x,0) -- (\x,4);
\end{scope}
\node at (-2,2.7) {$S=S\cap T$};
\draw[->] (-1,2.7) -- +(2.3,0);
\node at (-2,3.7) {$T=S\cup T$};
\draw[->] (-1,3.7) -- +(1.5,0);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

For example, $P \cap \mathbb{N} = P,\; P \cup \mathbb{N} = \mathbb{N}$.

\item $S-T=\{x\mid x\in S \textrm{\ and \ } x\not\in T\}$. By definition, $S$ and $T$ are disjoint means $S\cap T=\emptyset$, that is, $x\in S$ implies $x\not \in T$, so every element in $S-T$ is in $S$.  

\item Let us prove $S\cap \emptyset = \emptyset$. $S\cap \emptyset=\{x\mid x\in S \textrm{\ and \ } x\in \emptyset\}$, but there are no $x$ such that $x\in \emptyset$ so there are no elements in $S\cap \emptyset$.
\end{enumerate}\vspace{-4ex}
\end{proof}

The operators $\cup$ and $\cap$ are commutative, associative and distributive.

\begin{theorem}\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $S \cup T = T \cup S$.
\item $S \cap T = T \cap S$.
\item $(S \cup T) \cup U = S \cup (T\cup U)$.
\item $(S \cap T) \cap U = S \cap (T\cap U)$.
\item $S \cup (T\cap U) = (S \cup T) \cap (S \cup U)$.
\item $S \cap (T\cup U) = (S \cap T) \cup (S \cap U).$
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
The reader is invited give informal proofs of these properties by drawing Venn diagrams.


\section{Sequences}
\index{Sequences}

\begin{definition}\label{def.sequences}
Let $S$ be a set. A \emph{finite sequence of elements of $S$} is a mapping
\[
f:\{0,\ldots,n-1\}\mapsto S\,.
\]
The \emph{length} of the sequence is $n$. An \emph{infinite sequence of elements of $S$} is a mapping
\[
f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto S\,.
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Let $S$ be the set of three colors $\{\mathit{red},
\mathit{yellow}, \mathit{green}\}$. Suppose that you are a traffic light and see a green light, but before you can cross the street, the light changes and you have to wait until the light is green again. $L_1$, the finite sequence of colors that you will see until you cross is:
\begin{displaymath}
f_{L_1}(0)=\mathit{green},\; f(1)_{L_1}=\mathit{yellow},\; f(2)_{L_1}=\mathit{red},\; f(3)_{L_1}=\mathit{green}\,.
\end{displaymath}
$L_2$, the infinite sequence of colors that the light shows (assuming that it is always on) is:
\begin{displaymath}
f_{L_2}(0)=\mathit{green},\; f_{L_2}(1)=\mathit{yellow},\; f_{L_2}(2)=\mathit{red},\; f_{L_2}(3)=\mathit{green},\; f_{L_2}(4)=\mathit{yellow},\; \ldots,
\end{displaymath}
where the ellipsis $\ldots$ indicates that we know how to continue
constructing the sequence. Alternatively, we could formally define the infinite
sequence $L_2$ as:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{ll}
f_{L_2}(i)=\mathit{green}&\mathrm{if}\; i\bmod 3 = 0\\
f_{L_2}(i)=\mathit{yellow}&\mathrm{if}\; i\bmod 3 = 1\\
f_{L_2}(i)=\mathit{red}&\mathrm{if}\; i\bmod 3 = 2\,.
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
\end{example}

The elements of a sequence are listed within parentheses $(\,)$ to differentiate them from the elements of sets which are written within braces $\{\,\}$. In a sequence $(s_0, s_1, s_2, \ldots)$, $s_i=f(i)$.

To continue the example:
\[
L_2=(\mathit{green},\; \mathit{yellow},\; \mathit{red},\; \mathit{green},\; \mathit{yellow},\; \mathit{red},\; \ldots)\,.
\]

\begin{definition}
A finite sequence of length $n$ is called an \emph{n-tuple}. The
following terms are also used: a $2$-tuple is a \emph{pair}, a $3$-tuple
is a \emph{triple}, a $4$-tuple is a \emph{quadruple}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example} Examples of sequences:
\begin{itemize}
\item A $1$-tuple: $(\mathit{red})$.
\item A pair: $(5, 25)$.
\item A triple: $(\mathit{red}, \mathit{yellow}, \mathit{green})$.
\item A different triple: $(\mathit{red}, \mathit{green}, \mathit{yellow})$.
\item A triple with repeated elements: $(\mathit{red}, \mathit{green}, \mathit{green})$.
\item An infinite sequence: $(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, \ldots)$.\qed
\end{itemize}
\end{example}
It is important to understand that a sequence can have multiple occurrences of the same element, whereas a set has only one occurrence of each element:
\begin{eqnarray*}
(\mathit{green},\; \mathit{yellow},\; \mathit{red},\; \mathit{green})&\neq& (\mathit{green},\; \mathit{yellow},\; \mathit{red})\\
\{\mathit{green},\; \mathit{yellow},\; \mathit{red},\; \mathit{green}\}&=& \{\mathit{green},\; \mathit{yellow},\; \mathit{red}\}\,.
\end{eqnarray*}

\section{Cartesian product}
\begin{definition}
Let $S_{1}, \ldots, S_{n}$ be sets. $S_{1}\times\cdots\times S_{n}$, their \emph{Cartesian product}\index{Cartesian product}, is the set of $n$-tuples $(s_1,\ldots,s_n)$, such that $s_i\in S_{i}$. If all the sets $S_{i}$ are the same set $S$, the notation $S^{n}$ is used for $S\times\cdots\times S$.
\end{definition}
The case $n=2$  is very common. Let $S$ and $T$ be sets. $S\times T$ is the set of all pairs $(s,t)$ such that $s\in S$ and $t\in T$.

\begin{example}\mbox{}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the set of
all pairs of real numbers. This set can be used to represent coordinates in the plane. The term Cartesian plane or Cartesian coordinates is often used for this set.
\item $\mathbb{N} \times \{\mathit{red}, \mathit{yellow},
\mathit{green}\}$ is the set of all pairs whose first element is a
number and whose second is a color. This could be used to represent the
color of a traffic light at different points of time: $(28,\mathit{red})$.
\item $\mathbb{N}^3$ can be used to represent dates as (day,month,year): $(11,12,1948)$.
\item $\mathbb{N}^3$ can also be used to represent times as (hours,minutes,seconds): $(16,38,52)$. Alternatively, $\mathbb{N}\times \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{N}^2 \times \mathbb{R}$ can represent times with fractions of a second: $(16,38,52.83)$.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

We leave it to the reader to prove the distributive laws for Cartesian products:
\begin{theorem}\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}
\item $S\times (T \cap U) = (S \times T) \cap (S\times U)$.
\item $S\times (T \cup U) = (S \times T) \cup (S\times U)$.
\item $(S \times T) \cap (U\times V) = (S \cap U) \times (T\cap V)$.
\item $(S \times T) \cup (U\times V) = (S \cup U) \times (T\cup V)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}


\section{Relations}\label{s.relation}

\begin{definition}
Let $S_1, S_2, \ldots$ be a set of sets. An \emph{$n$-ary relation} $\mathbb{R}$ is a subset of $S_{1}\times \cdots \times S_{n}$. $\mathbb{R}$ is said to be a relation \emph{on} $S_{1}\times \cdots \times S_{n}$. \index{Relation}
\end{definition}
\vspace{-2ex}
For $n=1$, a subset of $S_1$ is called a \emph{unary relation}. For $n=2$, a subset of $S_1\times S_2$ is called a \emph{binary relation}.\footnote{Velleman [3, Definition 4.2.1, p. 171] uses the term \emph{relation} for what we can a \emph{binary relation}. In mathematical logic, $n$-ary relations are used to define interpretations for $n$-ary predicates [2, Definition 7.16, p. 136], so we use the more general definition.}



\begin{example}
Here are some relations over $\mathbb{N}^k$ for various $k\ge 1$:
\begin{itemize}
\item The set of prime numbers $P$ is a relation on
$\mathbb{N}^1=\mathbb{N}$.

\item
$SQ = \{(n_1,n_2)\in \mathbb{N}^2\mid n_2=n_1^2\}$ is a relation on
$\mathbb{N}^2$; it is the set of pairs of numbers and their squares:
$(4,16)\in SQ\comma (7,49)\in SQ\comma (10,99)\not \in SQ$.

\item $RP$ is the set of relatively prime numbers, that is, pairs of numbers that have no common divisor except for $1$:
\[RP = \{(n,m)\in \mathbb{N}^2\mid n \bmod k = 0 \;\textrm{and}\;
m \bmod k = 0 \;\textrm{implies}\; k = 1\}
\]
Examples are:
$(4,9)\in RP\comma (15,28) \in RP\comma (14,63)\not\in RP$.

\item $PT$, Pythagorean triples, are triples of values that can be the lengths of the sides of a right triangle:
\[
\{(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{N}^3\mid x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}\}\,.
\]
 Examples are $(3,4,5)\in PT\comma (8,15,17)\in PT\comma (6,8,9)\not\in PT$.
 
\item Let $F$ be the set of quadruples $\{(x,y,z,n)\in \mathbb{N}^4\mid x,y,z>0, n>2 \;\textrm{and}\; x^{n}+y^{n}=z^{n}\}$. Fermat's Last Theorem (which was recently proved) states that $F=\emptyset$, the empty set.
\end{itemize}
\end{example}

\begin{definition}\label{def.reflextrans}
Let $S$ be a set and $R$ a binary relation on $S^{2}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $R$ is \emph{reflexive} iff $R(x,x)$ for all $x\in S$.
\item $R$ is \emph{symmetric} iff $R(x_{1},x_{2})$ implies
$R(x_{2},x_{1})$.
\item $R$ is \emph{transitive} iff $R(x_{1},x_{2})$ and $R(x_{2},x_{3})$
imply $R(x_{1},x_{3})$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
$R^{*}$, the \emph{reflexive transitive closure of a binary relation $\mathbb{R}\subseteq S\times S$},
\index{Closure!reflexive transitive} is the smallest relation that satisfies:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $R\subseteq R^{*}$.
\item $R^{*}(x,x)$ for any $x\in S$.
\item For any $x_1,x_2,x_3\in S$, if $R^{*}(x_{1},x_{2})$ and
$R^{*}(x_{2},x_{3})$ then $R^{*}(x_{1},x_{3})$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
Consider the set $G=\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g\}$ and the relation $\rho$ defined by:
\[
\begin{array}{llllll}
\rho(a,b)\,, & \rho(b,a)\,, & \rho(b,d)\,, & \rho(d,a)\,,& \rho(c,e)\,,\\
\rho(f,e)\,,&\rho(f,c)\,,&\rho(c,g)\,,&\rho(g,f)\,,&\rho(g,g)\,.\\
\end{array}
\]
It is easy to visualize the relation by drawing a graph with a node for each element of $G$ and a directed arrow from node $n_1$ to node $n_2$ if $\rho(n_1,n_2)$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\node[draw,circle] (a) at (1,0)   {$a$};
\node[draw,circle] (b) at (2,2)   {$b$};
\node[draw,circle] (c) at (-2,0)  {$c$};
\node[draw,circle] (d) at (4,-1)  {$d$};
\node[draw,circle] (e) at (-1,-2) {$e$};
\node[draw,circle] (f) at (-4,2)  {$f$};
\node[draw,circle] (g) at (-4,-1) {$g$};
\draw[->] (g) edge[in=-90,out=190,loop] (g);

\draw[->,bend left=30] (a.north) to (b.west);
\draw[->] (b) to (d);
\draw[->] (d) to (a);
\draw[->,bend left=30] (b.south) to (a.east);

\draw[->] (f) -- (c);
\draw[->] (c) -- (e);
\draw[->] (c) -- (g);
\draw[->] (g) -- (f);
\draw[->] (f) edge[out=0,in=90] (e);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The relation $\rho$ is not reflexive: although the relation is reflexive at node $g$ since $\rho(g,g)$ is in the relation, the relation does not include $\rho(e,e)$ and similarly for the other nodes. The relation is also not transitive: although the relation is transitive for the nodes $f,c,e$ since $\rho(f,c), \rho(c,e), \rho(f,e)$ are in the relation, the relation does not include $\rho(g,e)$ even though it does include $\rho(g,f),\rho(f,e)$.

$\rho^{*}$, the reflexive transitive closure of $\rho$, includes $\rho^{*}(n,n)$ for every $n\in G$, as well as $\rho^{*}(n_1,n_2)$ if there exists a \emph{path} $n_1,\ldots,n_2$ in the graph from $n_1$ to $n_2$.

There are no elements in $\rho$ such that $\rho(x,y)$ for $x\in \{a,b,d\}$ and $y=\in\{c,e,f,g\}$, nor are there such elements in $\rho^{*}$. If you look again at (3) in the definition, we have to ensure $\rho^{*}(x_1,x_3)$ only if $R^{*}(x_{1},x_{2})$ and $R^{*}(x_{2},x_{3})$, but there are no such elements in the relation or its reflexive transitive closure, so the requirement is vacuous.

\section{Functions}

\begin{definition}\label{def.relfunc}
Let $F$ (function) be a relation on
$S_{1}\times \cdots \times S_{n}$. $F$ is a \emph{function}
\index{Function}
iff for every $n\!\!-\!\!1$-tuple $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n-1})\in S_{1}\times
\cdots \times S_{n-1}$, there is at most one $x_{n}\in S_{n}$, such that
$F(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})$.
\end{definition}

\smallskip

\begin{example}
The relation $SQ = \{(n_1,n_2),n_1,n_2\in \mathbb{Z}\mid  n_2=n_1^2\}$ is a function because for each integer, there is exactly one integer that is its square. The relation $SQRT = \{(n_1,n_2),n_1,n_2\in \mathbb{Z}\mid n_2^2=n_1\}$ is \emph{not} a function because there are integers that have two (integer) square roots, one positive and one negative, for example, $49=(7)^2$ and $49=(-7)^2$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
Here are some terms used to with functions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \emph{domain}\index{Function!domain} of $F$ is the
set of all $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n-1})\in S_{1}\times \cdots \times
S_{n-1}$ for which (exactly one)
\(x_{n}=F(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n-1})\) exists.
\item The \emph{range}\index{Function!range} of $F$ is the set
of all $x_{n}\in S_{n}$ such that
\(x_{n}=F(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n-1})\) for at least one
$(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n-1})$.
\item $F$ is \emph{total} if the domain of $F$ is
all of $S_{1}\times \cdots \times S_{n-1}$; otherwise, $F$
is \emph{partial}.\index{Function!total}\index{Function!partial}
\item $F$ is \emph{injective} or \emph{one-to-one} iff
\index{Function!injective}
$(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n-1}) \neq (y_{1},\ldots,y_{n-1})$ implies that
\[F(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n-1}) \neq
F(y_{1},\ldots,y_{n-1}).\]
\item $F$ is \emph{surjective} or \emph{onto} iff its range is
all of $S_{n}$.\index{Function!surjective}
\item $F$ is \emph{bijective} (\emph{one-to-one and onto}) iff it
is injective and surjective.\index{Function!bijective}
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\textbf{Notation}

$F:S_1\times \cdots S_{n-1}\mapsto S$ is used instead of $(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n-1})\in S_{1}\times \cdots \times S_{n-1},\; F(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\in S_n$. to indicate the domain and range of a function.

Similarly, the value of the function for an element of the domain can use functional notation or an expression can be given. For the example above, $n_2=SQ(n_1)=n_1^2$ for $n_1,n_2\in \mathbb{Z}$.


\begin{example}
The left diagram below shows the function:
\[
M2: \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\} \mapsto \{0,1\}\,, \textrm{\ where \ } M2(n) = n \bmod 2\,.
\]
The function is surjective (onto) but not injective (one-to-one).

The right diagram shows that the following function is neither surjective nor injective:
\[
M2': \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\} \mapsto \{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\}\,, \textrm{\ where \ } M2(n) = n \bmod 2\,.
\]

\begin{example}
$SQ= \{(n_1,n_2)\mid n_1,n_2\in\mathbb{Z} \textrm{\ and\ }  n_2=n_1^2\}$ is a total function. Its domain is all of $\mathbb{Z}$, but its range is
only the subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ consisting of all squares. Therefore
$SQ$ is not surjective and thus not bijective. It is also not injective because it is possible that $n_1 \neq n_2$, but $n_1^2=n_2^2$, for example, $7\neq -7$ but $49=49$.

For each $n\in \mathbb{N}$ define the set:
\[
CY =(a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1}), \textrm{\ where\ } a_{(i+1)\bmod n}=a_i+1\,.
\]
$CY$ is a sequence (which is also a set) such that elements are cyclic. For $n=5$, the elements of the set $CY$ are:
\[
(0,1,2,3,4)\,,\;(1,2,3,4,0)\,,\;(2,3,4,0,1)\,,\;(3,4,0,1,2)\,,\;(4,0,1,2,3)\,.
\]
Define the function $\textrm{rshift}$:
\[
\textrm{rshift}(a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4)\:=\:(a_4,a_0,a_1,a_2,a_3)\,.
\]
Clearly, the domain and the range of the function is all of $CY$. The function is bijective since for every $c_2\in CY$ there is one and only one $c_1\in CY$ such that $c_2=\textrm{rshift}\,(c_1)$.
\end{example}


\section{Cardinality}

\begin{definition}
The \emph{cardinality}\index{Set!cardinality} of a set is the number of
elements in the set. The cardinality of a $S$ is \emph{finite} iff there
is an integer $n$ such that the number of elements in $S$ is the same
that the number of elements in the set \(\{1,2,\ldots,n\}\). Otherwise
the cardinality is \emph{infinite}.

An infinite set $S$ is
\emph{countable}\index{Set!countable} if its cardinality is the same as
the cardinality of $\mathbb{N}$. Otherwise the set is
\emph{uncountable}\index{Set!uncountable}.\qed
\end{definition}

To prove that the cardinality of a finite set $S$ is $n$, we need to find a bijective function $f: \{1,\ldots,n\}\mapsto S$. To show that an infinite set is countable, we need to find a bijective function $f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto S$.

\begin{example}
The cardinality of $S=\{a,b,c,\ldots,x,y,z\}$, the set of lower-case English letters, is 26. The following function is bijective:
\[
f(1) = a\,,\;f(2) = b\,,\;f(3) = c\,,\;\ldots,\; f(24) = x\,,\;f(25) = y\,,\;f(26) = z\,.
\]
\end{example}
\begin{example}
$E$, the set of even natural numbers, is countable. Let $f$ be:
\[
f(0) = 0\,,\;f(1) = 2\,,\;f(2) = 4\,,\;\ldots\,.
\]
Of course we can't list the value of the function for every natural number, but we can give the definition of a function $f$ whose domain is $\mathbb{N}$ and whose range is $E$: $f(n)=2n$. We leave it to the reader to show that $f$ is bijective.
\end{example}

Infinite numbers are non-intuitive. The set of even natural numbers is a \emph{proper} subset of the set of natural numbers (because, for example, $3\in \mathbb{N},\, 3\not\in E$), but the cardinality of $E$ (the number of elements in $E$) is the same as the cardinality of $\mathbb{N}$ (the number of elements in $\mathbb{N}$)!

\begin{theorem}
$\mathbb{Z}$, the set of integers, is countable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
At first glance this seems impossible because $\mathbb{Z}$ has no ``first element.'' However, the definition of cardinality does not require that order be preserved, only that there be a bijective function. If we arrange the integers as follows it is obvious that $\mathbb{Z}$ is countable:
\[
0,1\,,\:-1\,,\:2\,,\:-2\,,\:3\,,\:-3\,,\:4\,,\:-4\,,\:\ldots\,,
\]
or in general:
\[
\begin{array}{l@{\hspace{3em}}l}
f(1)=0\\
f(k)=2k & \textrm{if\ } k>0\\
f(k)=2|k|+1 & \textrm{if\ } k<0\,.
\end{array}
\]
\end{proof}

It is worthwhile becoming familiar with the ``trick'' because it is used, for example, to prove that a Turing machine with a two-way tape, a tape that is infinite in two directions, can be simulated by a Turing machine with a one-way tape, a tape that is infinite in one direction. The two-way tape is ``folded over'' to become a one-way tape where each symbol on the tape encodes the symbol of the left-hand part of the tape and the right-hand part of the tape.

\begin{theorem}
The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$ is countable.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
This is more difficult than proving that $\mathtt{Z}$ is countable because rational numbers are infinite both in the numerator and the denominator. The trick is to order the rational numbers by the \emph{sum} of the numerator and the denominator. Within each sum the rational numbers are order by increasing demoninators:
\[
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\begin{array}{l@{\hspace{2em}}l}
\textrm{Sum}&\textrm{Rational numbers}\\
0 & 0\\
1 & 1\\
2 & 2\\
3& 3, \frac{1}{2}\\
4& 4, \frac{1}{3}\\
5 & 5, \frac{3}{2},\frac{2}{3}, \frac{1}{4}\\
6 & 6, \frac{1}{5}\\
7 & 7, \frac{5}{2},\frac{4}{3},\frac{2}{3},\frac{2}{5},\frac{1}{6}
\end{array}
\]
We have assumed that the rational numbers are reduced so that there is no common factor in both the numerator and the denominator. The negative rational numbers can be included as we did for the negative integers.
\end{proof}

Georg Cantor\index{Cantor, G.} first proved the following theorem:

\begin{theorem}
The set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Suppose to the contrary that there is a bijective function
$f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto \mathbb{R}$, so that it makes sense to talk about
$r_i$, the $i$-th real number. In fact, let us suppose that there is a bijective function $f:\mathbb{N}\mapsto \mathbb{R}, 0\leq r<1$. Each real number can be represented as an infinite decimal number:\footnote{The full proof must take account of a technical problem: two real numbers can have different sequences of digits, for example, $1.0000\cdots =0.9999\cdots$.}
\begin{displaymath}
r_i = 0.d_i^1 d_i^2 d_i^3 d_i^4 d_i^5 \cdots. 
\end{displaymath}
Consider now the real number $r$ defined by:
\begin{displaymath}
r = 0.e_1 e_2 e_3 e_4 e_5 \cdots, 
\end{displaymath}
where $e_i = (d_i^i + 1) \bmod 10$. That is, the first digit of $r$ is
different from the first digit of $r_1$, the second digit of $r$ is
different from the second digit of $r_2$, and so on. It follows that
$r\neq r_i$ for all $i\in \mathbb{N}$, contradicting the assumption
that $f$ was surjective. 
\end{proof}

This method of proof, called \emph{diagonalization}, is frequently used in computer science, for example, to prove that no Turing machine can decide whether an arbitrary Turing machine halts for a arbitrary input.

\section{Powersets}

\begin{definition}
Let $S$ be a set. The \emph{powerset} of $S$, denoted $2^S$, is the set of all subsets of $S$.\index{Set!powerset}
\end{definition}

\begin{example} Here is the powerset of the finite set
$S=\{\mathit{red}, \mathit{yellow}, \mathit{green}\}$:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{array}{l}
\{\\
\;\;\{\mathit{red}, \mathit{yellow}, \mathit{green}\},\\
\;\;\{\mathit{red}, \mathit{yellow}\}, \{\mathit{red}, \mathit{green}\},
\{\mathit{yellow}, \mathit{green}\},\\ 
\;\;\{\mathit{red}\}, \{\mathit{yellow}\}, \{\mathit{green}\},\\
\;\;\emptyset\\
\}.
\end{array}
\end{displaymath}
The cardinality of $S$ is $3$, while the cardinality of the powerset
is $8=2^3$.
\end{example}
\begin{theorem}
Let $S$ be a finite set of cardinality $n$;
then the cardinality of its powerset is $2^{n}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
A subset $S'$ is constructed by choosing for each $s\in S$ whether $s\in S'$ or $s\not\in S'$. These choices are independent:  for any $s_i$, once we have chosen $s_i\in S'$ or $s_i\not\in S'$, for each $s_j\in S$, $j\neq i$ the choice $s_j\in S'$ or $s_j\not\in S'$ does not depend on our previous choice for $s_i$. Therefore, the number of subsets is:
\[
\overbrace{2\cdot 2\cdot 2 \cdots 2\cdot 2}^{n} = 2^n\,.
\]
\end{proof}

A diagonalization argument can be used to show that $2^\mathbb{N}$ is not countable so its cardinality is larger than the cardinality of $\mathbb{N}$ which is denoted $\aleph_0$ (read ``aleph 0''). The cardinality of $2^\mathbb{N}$ is denoted $\aleph_1$ and $\aleph_1 >\aleph_0$. If we again take powersets, we find an infinite hierarchy of ever larger cardinalities. However, these are rarely encountered in computer science.

\section{Induction}

To prove a property of a set mathematical induction can be used. We give an overview of induction; for more detail see [2].

\begin{axiom}[Mathematical induction]\label{ax.induction} Let $P(n)$ be a property, $n\in \mathbb{N}, n>0$. If you can:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Base case}: Prove $P(1)$.
\item \emph{Inductive step}: For arbitrary $m\in \mathbb{N}$, prove $P(m+1)$ under the assumption that $P(m)$ is true.
\end{itemize}
Then you have proved $P(n)$ for all $n\geq 1$.\\
The assumption that $P(m)$ is true for arbitrary $m$ is called the \emph{inductive hypothesis}.
\end{axiom}
Here is a simple theorem that can be  proved using mathematical induction:
\begin{theorem}\label{t.sum}
For $n\geq 1$:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\,.
\]
\end{theorem}

\textbf{Proof} The base case is trivial:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^1 i = 1 =\frac{1(1+1)}{2}\,.
\]
The inductive hypothesis is that the equation is true for $m$:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{m} i = \frac{m(m+1)}{2}\,.
\]
The inductive step is to prove the equation for $m+1$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum_{i=1}^{m+1} i &=& \sum_{i=1}^m i + (m+1)\label{l.sum1}\\
&\ih{}&\frac{m(m+1)}{2} + (m+1)\label{l.sum2}\\
&=&\frac{m(m+1) + 2(m+1)}{2}\label{l.sum3}\\
&=&\frac{(m+1)(m+2)}{2}\,.\label{l.sum4}
\end{eqnarray}

By the axiom of mathematical induction:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\] is true for any $n\geq 1$.\qed

Let us now justify the reasoning in the inductive step. In~(\ref{l.sum1}) the sum is rewritten as two terms: the first term is the sum of the numbers from $1$ to $m$ and the second term is the number $(m+1)$. In~(\ref{l.sum2}), the notation $\ih{}$ denotes that the \emph{inductive hypothesis} is used to substitute $\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$ for $\sum_{i=1}^m i$. The rest of the proof (\ref{l.sum3}--\ref{l.sum4}) uses elementary algebra.

Axiom~\ref{ax.induction} is the simplest form of induction. It can be generalized:
\begin{itemize}
\item The base case need not be $n=1$.
\item The inductive step need not be $n+1$.
\item There may be more than one base case.
\item There may be more than one inductive step.
\item The inductive hypothesis can assume $P(k)$ for \emph{all} $k\leq m$ and not just for $k=m$.
\end{itemize}

Induction is used in all fields of mathematics. Here is a nice example of the use of induction to prove a formula of trigonometry:
\begin{theorem}
For $n\geq 1$:
\[
\cos\theta \cdot \cos 2\theta \cdot \cos 4\theta \cdot \cdots \cdot \cos 2^{n-1}\theta = \frac{\sin 2^n\theta}{2^n \sin \theta}\,.
\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Base case: $\cos \theta = \frac{\sin 2\theta}{2\sin \theta}$ because $\sin 2\theta = 2\cos\theta\sin\theta$.

Inductive step:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\cos\theta\cdots \cos 2^{n}\theta &=& (\cos\theta\cdots \cos 2^{n-1}\theta) \cdot \cos 2^{n}\theta\\
&\ih{}&\frac{\sin 2^{n}\theta}{2^{n}\sin \theta}\cdot \cos 2^{n}\theta\\
&=& \frac{1}{2^{n}\sin \theta} \cdot \cos 2^n\theta\sin 2^{n}\theta\\
&=& \frac{1}{2^{n}\sin \theta} \cdot \frac{\sin 2\cdot 2^{n}\theta}{2}\\
&=&\frac{\sin 2^{n+1}\theta}{2^{n+1}\sin \theta}\,.
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{proof}

In computer science the form of induction most often used is \emph{structural induction}. Suppose that you want to prove a property of trees. The base case is the trivial tree consisting of a single leaf. The inductive hypothesis is that the property is true for trees of height less than or equal to $h$. The inductive step is to prove the property for trees of height $h+1$, where the subtrees are obviously of height less than or equal to $h$.

Here is a rather complicated proof using induction in computer science. We knowledge of nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) and regular expressions (RE) is assumed.

\begin{theorem}
Let $r$ be an RE. Then there is an NFA that accepts the language of $r$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
There are \emph{three} base cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item $r$ is the empty set $\emptyset$. The NFA consisting of one initial and one final state with no transitions. It accepts no strings.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[circle]
\node (dummy) at (-1,0) {};
\node (initial) at (0,0) [draw,minimum size=12pt] {};
\node (final) at (1.5,0) [draw,minimum size=15pt] {};
\node at (1.5,0) [draw,minimum size=12pt] {};
\draw[->] (dummy) -- (initial);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\item $r$ is the null string $\epsilon$. The NFA consisting of one state which is both initial and final. It accepts the null string:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[circle]
\node (dummy) at (-1,0) {};
\node (final) at (0,0) [draw,minimum size=15pt] {};
\node at (0,0) [draw,minimum size=12pt] {};
\draw[->] (dummy) -- (final);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\item $r$ is a single symbol $a$. The following NFA accepts the language $\{a\}$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[circle]
\node (dummy) at (-1,0) {};
\node (initial) at (0,0) [draw,minimum size=12pt] {};
\node (final) at (1.5,0) [draw,minimum size=15pt] {};
\node at (1.5,0) [draw,minimum size=12pt] {};
\draw[->] (dummy) -- (initial);
\draw[->] (initial) -- node[above] {$a$} (final);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{itemize}

There are \emph{three} inductive steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item Concatenation $r_1r_2$: By the inductive hypothesis there are NFAs $\mathit{nfa}_1$ and $\mathit{nfa}_2$ that accept the languages of $r_1$ and $r_2$, respectively. Construct $\mathit{nfa}_{12}$ by adding a null transition from the final state of $\mathit{nfa}_1$ to the initial state of $\mathit{nfa}_2$. The initial state of $\mathit{nfa}_{12}$ is the initial state of $\mathit{nfa}_1$ and its final state is the final state of $\mathit{nfa}_2$.

\node at (1.5,0) [draw,minimum size=8] {};

\node at (7,0) [draw,minimum size=8] {};
\draw[->] (dummy) -- (initial);
\draw[->] (final1) -- node[above] {$\epsilon$} (initial2);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\item Union $r_1+r_2$: By the inductive hypothesis there are NFAs $\mathit{nfa}_1$ and $\mathit{nfa}_2$ that accept the languages of $r_1$ and $r_2$, respectively. Construct $\mathit{nfa}_{12}$ by adding new start and final states and null transitions.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[minimum size=12pt,rounded corners]
\node (initial) at (-2,0) [draw] {};
\node (final) at (7,0) [draw,minimum size=15pt] {};
\node at (7,0) [draw] {};
\node (dummy) at (-3,0) {};
\node at (2.5,.8) [draw,rectangle,minimum width=4cm,minimum height=.5cm] {$\mathit{nfa}_1$};
\node at (2.5,-.8) [draw,rectangle,minimum width=4cm,minimum height=.5cm] {$\mathit{nfa}_2$};
\node (top-initial) at (1,.8) [draw,minimum size=8] {};
\node (top-final) at (4,.8) [draw,minimum size=10pt] {};
\node at (4,.8) [draw,minimum size=8] {};
\node (bottom-initial) at (1,-.8) [draw,minimum size=8] {};
\node (bottom-final) at (4,-.8) [draw,minimum size=10pt] {};
\node at (4,-.8) [draw,minimum size=8] {};
\draw[->] (dummy) -- (initial);
\draw[->] (initial) -- node[above] {$\epsilon$} (top-initial);
\draw[->] (initial) -- node[above] {$\epsilon$} (bottom-initial);
\draw[->] (top-final) -- node[above] {$\epsilon$} (final);
\draw[->] (bottom-final) -- node[above] {$\epsilon$} (final);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\item Closure $r^*$: By the inductive hypothesis there is an NFA $\mathit{nfa}_r$ that accepts the language of $r$. Add new initial and final states and null transitions as shown in the diagram:
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}[minimum size=12pt,rounded corners]
\node (initial) at (0,0) [draw] {};
\node (final) at (8,0) [draw,minimum size=15pt] {};
\node at (8,0) [draw] {};
\node (initial1) at (2.5,0) [draw,minimum size=8] {};
\node (final1) at (5.5,0) [draw,minimum size=10pt] {};
\node at (5.5,0) [draw,minimum size=8] {};
\draw[->] (final1) to [bend right=30] node[above] {$\epsilon$} (initial1);
\node (dummy) at (-1,0) {};
\node at (4,0) [draw,rectangle,minimum width=4cm,minimum height=.5cm] {$\mathit{nfa}_r$};
\draw[->] (dummy) -- (initial);
\draw[->] (initial) -- node[above] {$\epsilon$} (initial1);
\draw[->] (final1) -- node[above] {$\epsilon$} (final);
\draw[->] (initial) to [bend right=30] node[above] {$\epsilon$} (final);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The null transition from the initial state to the final state is taken for strings generated by zero instances of $r$, and the internal transition from the final state of $\mathit{nfa}_r$ to its initial state is for more than one repetition of $r$.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}

\section{The Well-ordering Principle}\label{s.well}

The well-ordering principle is an axiom that is more intuitive than mathematical induction, although induction is much easier to use in practice.

\begin{definition} Let $S$ be a set with a binary relational operator $\leq$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $S$ is \emph{totally ordered} iff for any $x,y\in S$, either $x\leq y$ or $y \leq x$ or $x=y$.
\item A totally ordered set $S$ has a \emph{lower bound} iff there is some $b$ such that $b\leq n$ for all $n\in S$.
\item A totally ordered set $S$ has a \emph{least element} iff there is some $b\in S$ such that $b\leq n$ for all $n\in S$. A least element is also a lower bound, but in addition it is an element of the set.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
Subsets of $\mathbb{Z}$ are totally ordered:
\[
S=\{8,3,19,5,6,23\}\,,\quad E_Z=\{\ldots,-4,-2,0,2,4,\ldots\}\,,
\]
where $E_Z$ is the set of all even \emph{integers}. Some lower bounds for $S$ are $3, 0, -10$. The least element of $S$ is $3$. $E_Z$ \emph{does not} have a lower bound and therefore does not have a least element.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
The set of \emph{positive} rational numbers has an infinite number of lower bounds (zero and all negative rational numbers), but it has no least element because for any positive rational number $x$, $x/2$ is a smaller rational number.
\end{example}
\begin{definition} Let $S$ be a totally ordered set. $S$ is \emph{well-ordered} if \emph{every} nonempty subset of $S$ has a least element.
\end{definition}

$S$ is well-ordered because every nonempty subset has a least element. The least element of $S$ itself is $3$, the least element of $\{8, 19, 5\}$ is $5$. $E_Z$ is not well-ordered because $E_Z\subseteq E_Z$ but it has not least element. The set of even numbers in $\mathbb{N}$ is well-ordered.

\begin{axiom}\label{ax.wop} \textbf{(The well-ordering principle)} Every nonempty subset of the integers that has a lower bound is well-ordered.
\end{axiom}

If we assume Axiom~\ref{ax.induction} we can prove Axiom~\ref{ax.wop} and conversely (see [2]).
