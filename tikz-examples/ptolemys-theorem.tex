:Title: Ptolemy's theorem on quadrilaterals circumscribed by a circle
:Author: Moti Ben-Ari

:Slug: Ptolemy's theorem

Here are three theorems from Euclidean geometry:

  Theorem: The opposite angles of an isosceles trapezoid
    are supplementary.
  
  Theorem: A quadrilateral whose opposite angles are supplementary
    can be circumscribed by a circle.
  
  Theorem (Ptolemy): Let Q a quadrilateral circumscribed by a circle,
    let its two pairs of opposite sides be (a, b) and (c, d),
    and let its diagnonals be (e, f). Then ef = ab + cd.

The Mohr-Mascheroni Theorem shows that any construction
that can be done with straightedge and compass
can be done with a compass only!

One proof of this theorem uses Ptolemy's theorem.
The construction here is based upon the the proof presented in:
  "Surprising constructions with straightedge and compass",
  https://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari/mathematics,
which is based on presentations by Heinrich Doerrie and
Michael Woltermann.

TikZ features: name path, intersection, circle through,
  distance modifier, let...in, \pgfmathparse.
