:Slug: Ramanujan's approximation to pi

TikZ features: name path, name intersections, circle through,
  partway modifier, veclen, let..in


  With a straightedge and compass it is possible to construct
  any real number that can be obtained from the integers
  using the four arithmetic operators +, -, *, / and square roots.
  Only these numbers can be constructed. See, for example:
    John B. Fraleigh. _A First Course in Abstract Algebra,
    7th Edition_, Pearson, 2003, Section 32.
  Therefore, the value of pi cannot be constructed
  because pi is a transcendental number.
  
  There are approximations to pi such as 355/113 = 3.14159292,
  which differs from pi only in the seventh decimal place.
  Computing the circumference of the earth from its diameter,
  using 355/113 instead of pi gives an error of less than 4 meters!
  
  A naive construction of 355/113 would take hundreds of steps.
  Ramanujan found a clever construction that requires
  only 12 line segments.
    The Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society, 1913, p. 138.
    https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Squaring_the_circle.

  This examples gives Ramanujan's construction.
  
  Ramanujan (1887--1920) grew up in southern India and quickly
  advanced beyond the mathematical level of local colleges.
  He sent his work to G.H. Hardy who invited him to England.
  Ramanujan arrived in 1914 but could not return home
  until after World War I.
  He suffered from the cold climate and from the difficulty of
  adhering to a strict vegetarian diet.
  Ramanujan died at age 32 shortly after returning to India.
  His mathematics is still the subject of research.

    Construction

      1. The construction follows the one by Ramanujan.
         Occasionally, TikZ's calc library is used for brevity
         instead of the full construction, for example,
         to bisect a line segment.

      2. Each line segment will be labeled with its length.
         Only the outline of a composition is given;
         for details see:
         "Surprising constructions with straightedge and compass"
