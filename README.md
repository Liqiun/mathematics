Learning Materials for Secondary School Mathematics
===================================================

This repository contains learning materials for secondary school mathematics, as well as enrichment and more advanced tutorials. The PDFs can be also be downloaded from [my mathematics web page](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/sci-tea/benari/mathematics). All documents are in English and Hebrew unless otherwise noted.

bagrut
------
Fifteen fully solved Israeli matriculation exams in mathematics (806) (Hebrew only)

construct
---------
**Surprising constructions with straightedge and compass**
* A "collapsing" compass perform any construction that a "fixed" compass can. This is theorem 2 of Euclid's Elements, but many subsequent proofs are incorrect.
* Trisection. Although angles cannot be trisected using a straightedge and  compass, the construct can be performed using other tools.
* It is not possible to square a circle with straightedge and compass, because pi cannot be constructed. However, there are very precise approximations that can be constructed.
* Any construction possible with straightedge and compass can be performed with a compass only!
* Any construction possible with straightedge and compass can be performed with a straightedge only, provided that a single circle exists somewhere in the plane.
* Can there be non-congruent triangles with the same perimeter and area? The answer is yes! Here we show how to derive the values 156/35, 101/21, 41/15 of the edges of the triangle that have the same perimenter and area as the triangle with sides 3, 4, 5. (This result is not about construction with straightedge and compass but I included it anyway.

fivecolor
---------
**The five-color theorem**
While the four-color theorem is extremely difficult to prove, proving the five-color theorem is at all difficult, and follows from a theorem that a planar graph must have a vertex with at most five neighboring vertices. This document also contains an explanation of Alfred Kempe's incorrect proof of the four-color theorem.

geometry
--------
**Geometry without words** (language independent)  
An A2 sized poster with 15 theorems of secondary-school geometry displayed visually in color, but without words. It should be easier for students to see a color diagram than to understand textual theorems like "The intersection of the medians of a triangle divides the medians in the ration 2:1".

heptadecagon
------------
**The construction of a heptadecagon**
In 1796, when Carl Friedrich Gauss was 18 years old, he was able to show that a heptdecagon, a regular polygon with 17 sides, is constructible by straightedge and compass. This was the first new construction since the time of the ancient Greeks. This document presents Gauss's construction, together with the detailed computations that are invariably absent in other presentations.

induction
---------
**The many guises of induction**  
Induction is often presented as a mechanical procedure for proving properties of sequences, but it widely used in other areas of mathematics (geometry, trigonometry, logic) and in computer science (data structures, automata, formal languages). This document tries to show that induction is a uniform concept although it appears in many guises. (Some of the examples and exercises require a background in computer science and discrete mathematics.)

langford
--------
**Langford's problem**  
In the following arrangement of colored blocks:  
  Green Red Blue Red Green Blue  
There is one block between the red blocks, two blocks between the blue blocks and three blocks between the green blocks. Expressed in numbers, the bag of numbers {1,1,2,2,3,3} can be arranged in a sequence 312132 such that between the two occurrences of i there are i blocks. Langford's problem asks if this is always possible for {1,1,...,n,n}. Donald Knuth showed that solutions to Langford's problems can be easily found using SAT solvers, such as LearnSAT that I developed.

minesweeper
-----------
**Minesweeper is NP-complete**  
Richard Kaye showed that a puzzle based on the minesweeper game is NP-complete. This document presents Kaye's result with detailed explanations of the construction.

origami
-------
**The mathematics of origami**  
Origami is the art of paper folding. There is a mathematical formalization of origami as an axiomatic system. Geometric constructions can be done with origami that are impossible with straightedge and compass. This document presents the mathematics of origami using only secondary-school mathematics, primarily analytic geometry. Chapters:
* Axioms
* Trisecting an angle
* Doubling a cube
* Lill's method for finding roots of cubic polynomials
* Beloch's fold and Beloch's square
* Constructing a nonagon (regular polygon with 9 sides)
I would like to thank Oriah Ben-Lulu for introducing me to this topic.

**The mathematics of origami for secondary-school students**
Activities on the mathematics of origami with emphasis on the concept of geometric locus.

The Hebrew document was written by Oriah Ben-Lulu, at the Department of Science Teaching, Weizmann Institute of Science.

The English document is my translation and adaptation of her work.

probability
-----------
**Two interesting problems from Frederick Mosteller's book**  
This document is based upon the first two problems from Frederick Mosteller. _Fifty Challenging Problems in Probability with Solutions_, Dover, 1965. The problems are appropriate for secondary-school students. My solution of the first problem is different from Mosteller's, demonstrating that problems in mathematics can have multiple solutions. The second problem is interesting because the solution is counter-intuitive. Mosteller shows that the counter-intuitive solution is obvious once the problem is analyzed.

quadratic
---------
**Po-Shen Lo's method for solving quadratic equations**  
Po-Shen Loh developed an alternate method for solving quadratic equations that does not require memorization of the traditional formula. This document presents Loh's method with additional examples and details of the computation.

quaternions
-----------
**Quaternions for three-dimensional rotations** (English only)  
This is a tutorial on Euler angles and quaternions for describing rotations in three dimensions.

tikz-examples
-------------
**Demonstration of TikZ constructs** (language independent)  
Well-documented examples of TikZ diagrams for Euclidean geometry:  
* the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of a triangle is the center of the circumscribed circle
* the intersection of the medians of a triangle divide the medians in the ration 2:1
* Ptolemy's theorem relating the lengths of the diagonals and the lengths of the sides of a quadrilateral that is circumscribed by a circle
* Ramanujan's construction 355/113, an excellent approximation to pi.
  
trigonometry
------------
**A functional approach for teaching trigonometry**  
Trigonometric functions are usually taught to secondary-school students as ratios of the sides of a right triangle with degrees as the units of measure. This can cause problems when students encounter trigonometric functions in calculus, where the functions are defined for all real numbers, and where the units of measure must be radians in order to define derivatives. This document is a guide for teachers that examines teaching trigonometry initially as functions defining by "winding" a thread around the unit circle.

The Hebrew document was written by Avital Elbaum-Cohen, at the Department of Science Teaching, Weizmann Institute of Science.

The English document is my translation and adaptation of her work.

triples
-------
**Pythagorean triples**  
SAT solving is capable of solving mathemat^ical ^probl^ems beyond the reach of "normal" mathematical techniques. This document introduces SAT solving and gives an overview of the proof by Heule and Kullman that: in any division of the natural numbers into two disjoint subsets, at least one subset will contain a Pythagorean triple, that is, three numbers such that a^2 = b^2 + c^2.
